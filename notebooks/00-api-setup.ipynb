    "If you are not familiar with setting up access to data through an API, this will probably be the most frustrating part of this entire exercise. The following directions are *not* a step-by-step how to. I could not do better than the linked documentation! Rather they are a general guide to what you need to do to set yourself up to answer your own questions.\n",

    "If you skip the prep work, you will be limited to reading the notebooks in this guide without running them yourself. More importantly, if you want to pursue your own YouTube- and ChatGPT-based project (and not just create motivational messages), you must do this work. So...get to it! And enjoy the process."

    "1. Follow the steps in [YouTube's Data API Overview](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to obtain an API key. You will need a Google Developer account.\n",

    "My two step method is maybe not the best way -- storing keys in a config folder in my project and adding that folder name to .gitignore -- but it works.\n"

If you are concerned about rates, [check your account usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) any time.\n",

You will find instructions to create your key in the [Build Your Application section](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application). **As you did for your YouTube API key, save your OpenAI key somewhere safe** -- that is to say somewhere it will not end up in a repository. Remember: do NOT copy and paste the value into your code!\n",
