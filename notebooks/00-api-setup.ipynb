    "YouTube's Data API provides documentation, a sandbox, and a variety of language examples. This is a good one to practice the skill of learning how to use an API. Your pre-work is to set up your own access.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow the steps on with [YouTube's Data API Overview](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to obtain an API key. You will need a Google Developer account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then follow the steps on [YouTube's Python Quickstart page](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get your API key, put it somewhere safe! **Do not hard code your key into your code.** You can get fancy and use a key manager, but if you are relatively new to coding, put it in a file somewhere that will NOT be pushed to git. \n",
    "\n",
    "My two step method is maybe not the best way -- storing keys in a config folder in my project and adding that folder name to .gitignore -- but it works.\n"
