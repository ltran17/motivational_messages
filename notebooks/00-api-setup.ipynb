    "If you are not familiar with setting up access to data through an API, this will probably be the most frustrating part of this entire exercise. The following directions are *not* a step-by-step how to. I could not do better than the linked documentation! Rather they are a general guide to what you need to do to set yourself up to answer your own questions.\n",

    "If you skip the prep work, you will be limited to reading the notebooks in this guide without running them yourself. More importantly, if you want to pursue your own YouTube- and ChatGPT-based project (and not just create motivational messages), you must do this work. So...get to it! And enjoy the process."

    "YouTube's Data API provides documentation, a sandbox, and a variety of language examples. This is a good one to practice the skill of learning how to use an API. Your pre-work is to set up your own access.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow the steps on with [YouTube's Data API Overview](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to obtain an API key. You will need a Google Developer account.\n",

    "2. Then follow the steps on [YouTube's Python Quickstart page](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get your API key, put it somewhere safe! **Do not hard code your key into your code.** You can get fancy and use a key manager, but if you are relatively new to coding, put it in a file somewhere that will NOT be pushed to git. \n",
    "\n",
    "My two step method is maybe not the best way -- storing keys in a config folder in my project and adding that folder name to .gitignore -- but it works.\n"
