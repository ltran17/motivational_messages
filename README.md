# motivational_messages
Python tutorial to use OpenAI's API for Chat GPT3 to create motivational messages based on transcripts of YouTube videos.

### Objectives
In this tutorial, you will
* Use YouTube's API to get metadata about videos on a YouTube channel
* Use an open source package to get transcripts from YouTube videos
* Use OpenAI's API for Chat GPT3
* Be exposed to motivational messaging -- take what works for you and leave the rest

### The motivation behind `motivational_messages`
At the beginning of the pandemic, a group of my friends created the QuaranTeam: we streamed exercise videos three times a week to support and motivate each other. Our virtual meetings provided solace during some very hard days. As much as I needed the social support, the exercise also helped clear my mind and maintained -- improved, even -- my physical and mental health. After trying out a variety of trainers, our favorite became [Sydney Houdyshell](https://www.youtube.com/@sydneycummingshoudyshell). 

The inspiration for this tutorial came from a conversation with the QuaranTeam as January 2023 kicked off and Sydney's messaging reflected the fresh start of a new year. She ends every workout with a cool down, and as she leads us through stretches, she free-styles a motivational talk. Her words can really hit home! I haven't been good about jotting down notes about what she said.

I suppose this project is its own New Year's resolution: keep track of Sydney's words of wisdom, but do it programatically. (I'm a data scientist, so, yeah, I'm scripting this and not writing it by hand.) An achievable, measurable goal! The notebooks in this repository reflect my journey as I deciphered two APIs and explored the game-changing technology of Chat GPT3.
